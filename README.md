# 3D_Scene
An interactive 3D scene built in C++ using OpenGL


Designing this software began with understanding OpenGL concepts such as texture and lighting. Before introducing these concepts I began by creating 
basic objects using indices and vertices drawn manually to experiment with C++ and openGL. Once I understood how these concepts come to life,
I learned how to incorporate .obj files into the application instead of writing out indices and vertices. This simplifies the process and allows
greater detail in development. 

This project exhibits my first experiences implementing computer graphics and visualization. I approached this software design by creating pseudocode and 
organizing the code in a manner that would run efficiently. Then I transposed the pseudocode into C++ and troubleshooted as needed. 

Some issues that occurred during this project were identifying the correct vertices and indices to complex 3D objects. To solve this issue, as stated above, I used 
blender to create these objects and import them into the application.
